This section presents a replication of the Hill Climbing Algorithm as implemented by Alvi et al., with the accompanying notebook detailing the process. The algorithm is employed to estimate the fundamental components of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs): Initial Probabilities (start state likelihoods), Transition Matrix (state-to-state transition probabilities), and Emission Probabilities (observation likelihoods given states).
